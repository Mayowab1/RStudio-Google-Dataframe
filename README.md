# RStudio-Google-Dataframe
This activity is focused on creating and using data frames in `R`. A data frame is a collection of columns containing data, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. Data frames are one of the basic tools you will use to work with data in `R`. And you can create data frames from different data sources.
I was able to create my own data frame from scratch and an additional table using vectors combining the two together and using the mutate function.
In this file you will be able to view the two tables I made named "People" and "Fruit_Ranks"
